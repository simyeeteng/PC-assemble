<p>Reflection:</p>
<p>In my opinion, this PC assemble held has let me gain a new experience as this is the first time I have the chance to look into the inner part of CPU. Besides, I have a chance to disassemble the CPU by myself. I really enjoy the whole process of PC assemble. Truely to say, I hope to have more learning by physically such as this PC assemble, as it was very helpful on the understanding compare to books and slides. This is because we can really touch on the components and interact with lecturers and even lab assistants immediately when we have any questions. Most importantly, we get to discuss with group mates and gain new idea. </p>
